INTRODUCTION   
Now a days, games play very vital role in everyday lives especially when we talk about learning or study through interactive games. So, in this project of mobile application, I have tried to make an interactive and user-friendly android application named "Wordify" where users enhance his/her vocabulary by playing this game. This game is time bound also means user have to complete given task in given time and if user complete task within given time, then user will be rewarded otherwise will lose the game.

•	Score board area 
•	Levels of three types (medium, high, low)
•	Timer

METHOD FOR USING APP
User just need to open application where user will be welcomed with a beautiful splash screen and them shown levels of three types named low, medium, and high. After selecting level type, users will be welcomed with a board of no of levels of more than 10 levels and after selecting level, user will be moved to actual game screen where a top bar contains words, a score field, a board contains letters. User just need to focus on given words on top and then try to make word by sliding his/her finger and if created word matched with one of the words shown on the top bar, then user will be rewarded with a point added on the score. Moreover, when user successfully guessed correct word, a music also plays in order to create an interactive environment. And, when user will successfully guess all words in the given time, a winning message will be shown otherwise user will lose the game.
