# Wordify - Android Project

## INTRODUCTION   
Nowadays, games play a very vital role in everyday life especially when we talk about learning or studying through interactive games. So, in this project mobile application, I have tried to make an interactive and user-friendly Android application named "Wordify" where users enhance his/her vocabulary by playing this game. This game is time-bound also means the user has to complete a given task in a given time and if the user completes the task within the given time, then the user will be rewarded otherwise will lose the game.

## MAIN FEATURES
- A Splash Screen
- A Board contains letters
- A top bar showing words
- Scoreboard area
- Levels of three types (medium, high, low)
- Timer

## METHOD FOR USING APP
Users just need to open the application where user will be welcomed with a beautiful splash screen and then shown levels of three types low, medium, and high. After selecting the level type, users will be welcomed with a board of no of levels of more than 10 levels, and after selecting a level, the user will be moved to an actual game screen where a top bar contains words, a score field, and a board contains letters. Users just need to focus on the given words on top and then try to make a word by sliding his/her fingers if the created word matches with one of the words shown on the top bar, then the user will be rewarded with a point added to the score. Moreover, when a user successfully guessed the correct word, a piece of music also played in order to create an interactive environment. And, when the user successfully guesses all words in the given time, a winning message will be shown otherwise user will lose the game. 

## TOOL SET
- Kotlin Programming Language
- Android Studio IDE
- AVD for Testing

## CONCLUSION   
So, this project named “WORDIFY” which is in the form of an Android application, will help people in learning or studying in an interactive way by playing games and enhancing vocabulary In the end when people use this app, they will get lots of benefits from it.
